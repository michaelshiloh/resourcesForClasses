/*
Vehicles that make associations (red = aggressive)

 Change log
 21 mar 2021 - ms - initial entry
 03 apr 2021 - ms - add ability to move vehicles
 04 apr 2021 - ms - aggression is random rather than based on vehicle speed
 07 apr 2021 - ms - remove all unnecessary stuff to make it easier to read
 
 Based on examples from The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman - Thanks Dan!
 
 This code is in the public domain
