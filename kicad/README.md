Some PCBs I have designed to help with my classes and other projects:
- ArduinoShieldHobbyRCAndMotorControl: Holes for 6 wires to connect
  to an L298 (or similary) dual H-bridge motor driver, and six connectors
  suitable for a hobby RC receiver. 
  Used in [Performing
  Robots](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots)
  but could be useful to
  anyone connecting an Arduino Uno to a hobby RC receiver or an L298 dual
  H-bridge motor driver.
- IC_sockets/16PinSocketAPC: breakout board for a 14 pin DIP, with silkscreen
  markings aimed at making at Atari Punk Console. I'll add a link to the full
  instructions when I find them.
- nRF_servo_Mega: Arduino Mega shield for mounting nRF24L01 and attaching six
  servo motors or NeoPixels strings with separate power supply
  Used in [Performing
  Robots](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots).
  but could be useful to
  anyone connecting an Arduino Mega to an nRF24L01
  or servo motors/NeoPixel strings.
- l298Interface: rather than using horrible jumper cables, this board fits
  directly to the 6 control pins on an L298 dual H-bridge motor driver and
  provides holes for soldering wires to the
  ArduinoShieldHobbyRCAndMotorControl above. Also includes a 3 position ground
  tie point to avoid having to jam 2 wires into one of the screw terminals.
  Used in [Performing
  Robots](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots) but could be
  generically useful.
- Arduino_Shield_RC_Controller: Obsolete. Do not use.
- Arduino_Shield_RC_Controller_v2: Wireless remote control panel using the
  nRF24L01.
  Used in [Performing
  Robots](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots)
  but could be useful to
  anyone wanting a wireless remote control panel using an nRF24L01.
- motorMatrixAdapter: starting point for my matrix-of-motors project
- ArduinoShieldServoMotors: Arduino Uno shield for 9 servo motors or NeoPixel
  strands with separate power supply.
  Used in [Machine 
  Lab](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/MachineLab) 
  but could be useful to
  anyone connecting servo motors to an Arduino Uno
- nRFControlPanel: Obsolete. Do not use.
